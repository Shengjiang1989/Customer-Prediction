# Machine_Learning-Potential_Customer_Prediction

•	Enhanced potential customer prediction accuracy to 90% by developing algorithms based on labeled data via Python and Spark

•	Trained supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest and K- Nearest Neighbors, and applied regularization with optimal parameters to overcome overfitting

•	Analyzed feature importance to identify top factors that influenced the results
